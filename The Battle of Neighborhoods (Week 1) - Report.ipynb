In 2019, the capital state of Malaysia, which is Kuala Lumpur, ranked 10th in destination popularity worldwide for tourists, with an approximate amount of 14.07 million tourists arriving. In the same year, Malaysia also ranked 22nd in worldwide tourism popularity with a total of 26 million tourists visiting the country. \n\nThe high popularity amongst tourists and backpackers eventually resulted in the rise of hotels and hostels in Kuala Lumpur. In 2019, there were a total amount of 4,826 of hotels in the capital state. With the increasing amount of hotels, it was expected there will be more people who are interested in starting a hotel. This project is mainly aimed to help owners to find the optimal location for business, which includes analysis such as:\n\n- What is the best location to start a new hotel in Kuala Lumpur?\n- Which area has more facilities around?\n\n"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## 2.
